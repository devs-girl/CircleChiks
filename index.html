                <p>Clara Melo, was born in Angola and spent his childhood in

                    For a few years worked as an interior designer. As a creative, 
                    she wanted more and decide to start his own Fashion Brand, 
                    a Portuguese Fashion brand that puts if focus on African fabrics. Whith two successful Fashion stores, one in Luanda 
                    and another in Lisbon, participations on fashion week 
                    events, and styling a few TV presenters and musicians. With 
                    the world changing and with a stronger and stronger opinion against fast fashion and unetical behavior of most producers. Feeling she part of the problem, Clara decided to 
                    end her brand, to make a new fair start, where she could explore more of her different talents in an inclusive, sustainable way, with natural or organic materials.
                    Now in transition and caught up in the pandemic. Clara sees 
                    the NFT's as another way to fulfill her mission not only as a 
                    creator, but as part of the circle. She believes that circle 
                    chiks can be more than 10000 images, because when many 
                    like-minded people get together, something positive happens in the world.
